      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <img src="images/error.png" alt="Poster Design" class="process-img">
      <p>Our project began with the realization that many students and teachers are passionate about sustainability, yet large amounts of electronic waste are produced during academic projects. This problem inspired us to find a solution that addresses both environmental concerns and student needs.</p>
      <p>Our primary audience includes CU Boulder students—especially those in engineering—aged 18 to 22, as well as professors and stakeholders such as the Distribution Center.</p>
      <p>The grand vision is to integrate our solution into CU’s existing system using the university’s official design language. We collaborated with professors and students to ensure the solution reflects real needs. We also recognized gaps in communication between colleges and aimed to address this through our iterative, engineering-based approach.</p>

      <h2>Project Process</h2>
      <div class="timeline-step">
        <h3>1. Research</h3>
        <p>We conducted interviews, surveys, and gathered insights from students and professors to understand their perspectives on sustainability and e-waste issues.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="timeline-step">
        <h3>2. Ideation</h3>
        <p>Our team brainstormed solutions and created early concepts. We also created storyboards and used color pickers to visualize our design direction.</p>

        <h3>3. Design</h3>
        <p>We built low, mid, and high fidelity prototypes in Figma to refine our ideas and align with user needs.</p>
        <div class="prototype-box">
          <h4>Mid Fidelity Prototype</h4>
          <img src="images/mid-fid.png" alt="Mid Fidelity Prototype" class="prototype">
          <p>The mid-fidelity version adds UI elements and layout refinements to test basic interaction and navigation.</p>

        <div class="prototype-box">
          <h4>High Fidelity Prototype</h4>
          <img src="images/high-fid.png" alt="High Fidelity Prototype" class="prototype">
          <p>Our final prototype closely resembles the finished product with actual colors, fonts, and interactivity. View it on Figma: <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/3k5nPrLCMkjIMEgbbW1j5T/capstone?node-id=291-132&p=f&t=TpSpdhwpcjoDf4g1-0" target="_blank">Figma Link</a></p>

        <h3>4. Development</h3>
        <p>
          We built the homepage and core functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

        <h3>6. Final Outcome</h3>
        <p>The final product is a solution designed to reduce e-waste and support sustainable practices among CU students. We also produced visual materials including posters, brochures, and graphic designs to raise awareness.</p>
