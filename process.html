                        Our project began with the realization that many students and teachers are
                        passionate about sustainability, yet large amounts of electronic waste are
                        produced during academic projects. This problem inspired us to find a solution
                        that addresses both environmental concerns and student needs.

                        Our primary audience includes CU Boulder students—especially those in
                        engineering—aged 18 to 22, as well as professors and stakeholders such as the
                        Distribution Center.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The grand vision is to integrate our solution into CU’s existing system using
                        the university’s official design language. We collaborated with professors and
                        students to ensure the solution reflects real needs. We also recognized gaps in
                        communication between colleges and aimed to address this through our iterative,
                        engineering-based approach.

                        professors to understand their perspectives on sustainability and e-waste

                        We built low, mid, and high fidelity prototypes in Figma to refine our ideas and
                        align with user needs. The mid-fidelity version adds UI elements and layout
                        refinements to test basic interaction and navigation. Our final prototype
                        closely resembles the finished product with actual colors, fonts, and
                        interactivity. View it on Figma:

                                    understand why their choices were incorrect, which helps reinforce learning
                                    about sustainability. And it also makes the quiz more interactive and encourages
                                    users to learn actively rather than passively.</p>
